      <h2> about </h2>
      I created notefeeder to help me keep track of interesting things I found while surfing Reddit and HN so I could find them later. 
      I didn't want to have to leave my current page to do so and wanted the option to jot down any notes or ideas at the same time. 
      <p>
        Notefeeder accomplishes this using a simple <a href='input_methods.html#bookmarklet'>bookmarklet</a> to create notes in just two clicks and RSS feeds to view what you created.
      </p>
      <p>          
        Its aim is to help you save things you like and what you were thinking at that time so you can come back to them later wherever you are.

			<h2>notes</h2>
      <div class='sub_content'>
       Notes are comprised of or one or more of the following parts. 
        <ul class='plain'>
            <li> <span class='title'>title:</span> Just a short(50 character) plain text field.  The bookmarklet with auto fill this with the current page's title.
            <li> <span class='title'>url:</span> the link the note is related to..  If the note is small you'll be taken to this url when you click on the note.
            <li> <span class='title'>description:</span> The main body of your note.  Supports <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown'>markdown</a> syntax.
        </ul>
        <br/>
        They also have a couple of settings which are:
        <ul class='plain'>
            <li><span class='title'>private flag:</span> You can set notes to be private(ish) editing the note and checking the "is private" box.  This will still show the notes title but will hide its url and description.
            <li><span class='title'>completed notes:</span> When you've marked a note as completed it will no longer appear in the lists RSS feed but will still show in the list but will be crossed out.  You can unmark a note by editing it and unchecking the "completed" box.
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2> lists </h2>
      You can use lists to group your notes into logical categories or just use the default list that is always availiable.  Each list has an RSS Feed assoicated with it.
